READCONFIG.java file
----------------------
config.properties contains inputs used for baseclass.Values are not used within quotes " "
./--can be used in java classes and in properties file.It represents current project home directory
./xxx/xxx-takes to the current project directory and searches from there
System.getProperty(user.dir)-can be used only in java class
ReadConfig.java class is a simple java program to read the values from the config.properties.refer to "./com.iNetBanking_v1.utilities\\ReadCongig.java"

REPORTING.JAVA
--------------
this uses extent report with testng listeners
extent version 5 don't use and doesnt support loading of extent-config.xml and also htmlReporter is deprecated and replaced with ExtentSparkReporter
Don's use ChartLocation and extent-config.xml anymore
check for user defined screenshot method in listener class..check the output with and without it
After adding listeners and integrating it with test cases in testNG.xml by giving pkg.listenerclassname without extn in listener tag under suite tag
from now onwards execution of code is from testNG xml only

CHANGES FROM PAVAN TRAINING REPORTING CLASS AND MY REPORTING CLASS
FOR FAILURE and SKIPPED TEST CASE SCREENSHOTS
----------------------------------------------
changes from pavan training reporting class from my class is
**********
1)chk pavan training class for the failure n skipped screenshot-EXECUTE IT AND CHECK
.User defined method is in baseclass for this and this is called from the login test cases and any other test cases in failure cndn..
best reporting class is my class..as there neednt be any changes done in test cases to add extra stt for failure to capture the screenshot
everything is done in reporting class itself..TRY EXECUTING THIS LATER AND CHECK ITS WORKING
Skipped cndn cant have screenshot in his approach only failure case can have..My approach is best for getting screenshot for both failure and skipped
***********
2)i added user -defined screenshot method inside the reporting class by getting driver object from baseclass using BASECLASS.driver
3)and taking screenshot and creating it in the folder and also added in the report
4)added screenshot for skipped test case too for more details and added logger from baseclass to update in log using BASECLASS.logger
as reporting class also uses one logger object.
As webdriver is declared static in baseclass no need to create object to use driver or logger.Use the classname directly to call it.
Java program itself suggesting when object is created for baseclass and when used
5)For skipped test case, disconnect internet and run the testNG xml
For failure change the title to mismatch
6)For background color change change in the reporting class the theme to dark or standard
7)TRY STACK OVERFLOW REPORTING CLASS APPROACH


XLUTILS class
-------------
add apache poi-poi n poi-ooxml 2 dependencies
use this same code for all excel sheet reading of data..it has standard codes
It counts the rouw count and column count dynamically at run time only..
so used for all excel files to read data and write data to and from excel file

all are static reusale methods to work with excel file
just call directly the method wherever needed
use / or \\ and check for both and decide what to be used for path specify..test using both / and \\
