We dont require in latest selenium version as the webDriver manager downloads it.Only this is used when using 
System.setProperty(setting of driver and its path)
we are now using WebDriverManager-So no need to use System.setProperty to set the drivers and its path.
So check whether have these in drivers folder is useful or not
Try executing code with and without the drivers folder
copy gecko and ie drivers.exe file too
have those browsers also ready
